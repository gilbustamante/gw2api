# Guild Wars 2 Web Companion
Simple web app that keeps track of things the average [GW2](https://www.guildwars2.com) player cares about.  
### Features
* Accepts a GW2 public API key and stores it as a (signed) cookie for convenience.
* Keeps track of daily PVE, PVP, WVW, and Fractal daily achievements (both current day and the next).
* Users can search through the following, with results displayed in real time:
  * Trading post history (bought and sold) for a given account.
  * Current trading post orders (buy and sell).
  * Given account's bank inventory.
### To Do
* Add trading post 'watcher' feature that monitors trading post prices and compares them with the user's orders, alerting the user if they have been outbid/undercut.
* Add ability to calculate expected profit and/or ROI for an item based on buy price, sell price and listing/exchange fees.
* More account stats.
